# Machine Learning Gesture Detect

## Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for image classification, specifically hand gesture recognition. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying hand gestures into 18 distinct categories, which is crucial for applications such as human-computer interaction, sign language interpretation, and virtual reality.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 125,912 images of hand gestures, each labeled into one of 18 classes. The dataset was split into training (70%), validation (10%), and testing (20%) subsets.

## Models

Several CNN architectures were tested, including:

1. **Light CNN**
2. **Heavy CNN**
3. **Greyscale CNN**
4. **Data Augmentation CNN**
5. **VGG-16**
6. **Enhanced VGG-16**

  - Last four layers unfrozen for fine-tuning.
- **Performance**:
  - Validation Accuracy: 93.64%
  - Test Accuracy: 91.69%
  - Training Duration: 10 epochs

## Methodology

1. **Data Pre-Processing**:
   - Image Resizing: Standardized to either 64x64 or 128x128 pixels.
   - Normalization: Pixel values normalized to [0, 1].
   - Data Splitting: Training (70%), validation (10%), testing (20%).

2. **Data Labelling**:
   - Labels provided in categorical format and converted to one-hot encoding.

3. **Data Scaling**:
   - Images resized to fit the input requirements of models.

   - Class distribution, confusion matrix, accuracy, and loss curves plotted.

5. **Additional Techniques**:
   - Data augmentation: Random zoom, rotation, flips, contrast adjustments.
   - Early stopping and learning rate scheduling implemented.

## Results

- **Light CNN**: High validation accuracy with rapid convergence.
- **Heavy CNN**: High validation accuracy but longer training and inference times.
- **Greyscale CNN**: Lower validation accuracy, indicating the importance of color information.
- **Data Augmentation CNN**: Improved generalization due to augmented training data.
- **VGG-16**: Lower validation accuracy, suggesting potential issues with the transfer learning approach.
- **Enhanced VGG-16**: Highest validation and test accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of increased input size and extensive data augmentation.

## Conclusion

The Enhanced VGG-16 model outperformed the other models, achieving the highest accuracy and excellent generalization capabilities. Simpler models like the Light CNN provide a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making them suitable for real-time applications. This study highlights the importance of choosing the right model architectures and preprocessing techniques to optimize performance for specific tasks.
